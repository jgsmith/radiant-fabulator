Fabulator
=========

Fabulator is an extension to the [Radiant CMS][] for creating web applications
that manage data in a set of RDF models.  The applications are written in an
XML language that describes the set of application views and the data that
triggers a move from one view to the next, along with initial conditions for
the application and data transformations that may store data in the RDF models.
